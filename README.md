# HydriusChat
A chat plugin for Project Hydrius.

## Overview
This plugin accomplishes a variety of things. It attempts to group server types together into one chat, which allows users to communicate more to other players on the server. It features channels, and allows players to join, leave, and create their own channels - which can be password (PIN) protected. It allows players to private message each other and reply easily.

## Features
* Global (Cross-Server) channels
* Server channels
* Player-created channels
* Password protected channels
* Permission based channels
* Private messaging

## Dependencies
The plugin currently depends on [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) and [PlaceholderAPI](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/) in order to work. The plugins will only work on Velocity (Proxy Server) and Paper (Backend Server)
